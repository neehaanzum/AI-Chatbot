## Project Description
Access to timely medical advice is crucial, especially in remote or underserved areas. This AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot aims to bridge the gap by offering preliminary health assessments, symptom checking, and medical recommendations. Using NLP, the chatbot interacts with users in a conversational manner, providing guidance based on trained models and medical databases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of structured and unstructured medical records, symptom-disease mappings, and conversational medical dialogues. The data sources include:

### Key Details:
- **Total Records:** 50,000+ medical cases
- **Training Data:** 85% of the dataset
- **Test Data:** 15% of the dataset
- **Classes:** Common diseases and symptoms
- **Purpose:** To enable AI-driven medical consultations and preliminary diagnosis.

### Approach:
- Reviewed medical literature and healthcare chatbots.
- Analyzed symptom patterns and mapped them to probable diseases.
- Utilized NLP techniques to understand and process user queries.
- Integrated APIs for real-time medical data retrieval and validation.

**Note:** Ensure appropriate dataset licensing and compliance with healthcare data privacy regulations.

## Model Architecture
The chatbot uses a hybrid architecture combining NLP and deep learning:

- **NLP Pipeline:**
  - Tokenization
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Intent Classification
  - Response Generation

- **Deep Learning Model:**
  - LSTM-based RNN for sequential data processing
  - Attention Mechanism for contextual understanding
  - Pretrained Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) for enhanced comprehension

## Training
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Epochs:** Configurable (default: 25)
- **Batch Size:** Configurable (default: 32)
- **Data Augmentation:** Used for enhancing model performance

## Weekly Progress
This section will be updated weekly with progress details and corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.
